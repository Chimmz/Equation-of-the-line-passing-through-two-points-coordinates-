This project is written in C++. It calculates and produces the equation of the line that passes through two user-specified coordinte points, where each of the two points can be represented as a pair of x and y coordinates, and x and y are integers.
The project uses Object-oriented programming. It defines Point and Line as two separate classes with methods
